Description: Built on top of broom, knitr, and kableExtra, whisk has two 
    goals: First, allow for multiple nested tidy models with extra data from 
    broom::glance in a single data.frame using function whisk. Second, convert
    tidied models (generated by either whisk::whisk or broom::tidy) into 
    Stargazer-like tables, using knitr::kable and kableExtra.
Imports:
    dplyr,
    tidyr,
